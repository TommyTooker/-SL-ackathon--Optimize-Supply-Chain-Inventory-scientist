Effectively manage and optimize inventory by capturing variables such as lead times, manufac-
turing frequency, batch size, and ordering policies from across the supply chain. Using algo-

adjust inventories to optimal levels. Maintain the right amount of inventory required to meet 
demand, keep logistics costs low, and avoid common inventory issues such as stockouts, over-
stocking, and backorders.
